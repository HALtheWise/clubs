# SONIC (SONIC: Olin Nigh-Impossible Club)
*Last modified 2016-09-01*

##Purpose
We want to do things that have never been done before-- think of it like a modular project team. As a first project, we will attempt to make a supersonic rockoon (balloon-launched rocket plane, not the trash panda) in a space shot.

##Membership
Membership is open to all who are interested! We welcome anyone of any background and experience level.

##Officers and Roles
At this point, we're small enough that we don't need a leadership team, but will nominate a Liason for handling official communication.

##Transition Protocol
The current Liason can transfer the role to another member with their consent.

##Club Materials, Purchases and Space
We will use as many ready available materials on campus as possible, such as scrap or tools from the Robotics Lab (with supervisors' approval). Meetings will be held in the library (until further notice) and we may need storage for engine/rocket parts.

##Events and Activities
This fall we will be attending a high power model rocketry certification event, and organizing transport for any Oliners who are interested. Other events TBA, depending on goals and timeline.

##Amendment Procedure
The charter can be changed at any time with a reasonable consensus of active members.
